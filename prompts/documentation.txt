Create multi-page long and explicit professional pytorch-like documentation for the <MODULE> code below follow the outline for the <MODULE> library, 
provide many examples and teach the user about the code, provide examples for every function, make the documentation 10,000 words, 
provide many usage examples and note this is markdown docs, create the documentation for the code to document,
put the arguments and methods in a table in markdown to make it visually seamless

Now make the professional documentation for this code, provide the architecture and how the class works and why it works that way, 
it's purpose, provide args, their types, 3 ways of usage examples, in examples show all the code like imports main example etc

BE VERY EXPLICIT AND THOROUGH, MAKE IT DEEP AND USEFUL

# Module/Function Name: MultiheadAttention

class torch.nn.MultiheadAttention(embed_dim, num_heads, dropout=0.0, bias=True, add_bias_kv=False, add_zero_attn=False, kdim=None, vdim=None, batch_first=False, device=None, dtype=None):
    """
    Creates a multi-head attention module for joint information representation from the different subspaces.
    
    Parameters:
    - embed_dim (int): Total dimension of the model.
    - num_heads (int): Number of parallel attention heads. The embed_dim will be split across num_heads.
    - dropout (float): Dropout probability on attn_output_weights. Default: 0.0 (no dropout).
    - bias (bool): If specified, adds bias to input/output projection layers. Default: True.
    - add_bias_kv (bool): If specified, adds bias to the key and value sequences at dim=0. Default: False.
    - add_zero_attn (bool): If specified, adds a new batch of zeros to the key and value sequences at dim=1. Default: False.
    - kdim (int): Total number of features for keys. Default: None (uses kdim=embed_dim).
    - vdim (int): Total number of features for values. Default: None (uses vdim=embed_dim).
    - batch_first (bool): If True, the input and output tensors are provided as (batch, seq, feature). Default: False.
    - device (torch.device): If specified, the tensors will be moved to the specified device.
    - dtype (torch.dtype): If specified, the tensors will have the specified dtype.
    """

    def forward(query, key, value, key_padding_mask=None, need_weights=True, attn_mask=None, average_attn_weights=True, is_causal=False):
        """
        Forward pass of the multi-head attention module.

        Parameters:
        - query (Tensor): Query embeddings of shape (L, E_q) for unbatched input, (L, N, E_q) when batch_first=False, or (N, L, E_q) when batch_first=True.
        - key (Tensor): Key embeddings of shape (S, E_k) for unbatched input, (S, N, E_k) when batch_first=False, or (N, S, E_k) when batch_first=True.
        - value (Tensor): Value embeddings of shape (S, E_v) for unbatched input, (S, N, E_v) when batch_first=False, or (N, S, E_v) when batch_first=True.
        - key_padding_mask (Optional[Tensor]): If specified, a mask indicating elements to be ignored in key for attention computation.
        - need_weights (bool): If specified, returns attention weights in addition to attention outputs. Default: True.
        - attn_mask (Optional[Tensor]): If specified, a mask preventing attention to certain positions. 
        - average_attn_weights (bool): If true, returns averaged attention weights per head. Otherwise, returns attention weights separately per head. Note that this flag only has an effect when need_weights=True. Default: True.
        - is_causal (bool): If specified, applies a causal mask as the attention mask. Default: False.

        Returns:
        Tuple[Tensor, Optional[Tensor]]:
        - attn_output (Tensor): Attention outputs of shape (L, E) for unbatched input, (L, N, E) when batch_first=False, or (N, L, E) when batch_first=True.
        - attn_output_weights (Optional[Tensor]): Attention weights of shape (L, S) when unbatched or (N, L, S) when batched. Optional, only returned when need_weights=True.

        # Implementation of the forward pass of the attention module goes here

        return attn_output, attn_output_weights

# Usage example:

multihead_attn = nn.MultiheadAttention(embed_dim, num_heads)
attn_output, attn_output_weights = multihead_attn(query, key, value)
